Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 7
* ts_idl 3.6
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* MTRotator IDL file built from ts_xml

v0.28.1
-------

* Fix enabling of the low-level controller (DM-32902): wait for one telemetry sample after first connecting.

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.8
* ts_idl 3.6
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 10.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.28.0
-------

* Update for ts_hexapod_controller 1.3.0 and ts_rotator_controller 1.4.0:

    * Use a single socket for communication with the low-level controller.
      Eliminate the `CommandTelemetryServer` class, moving its non-server functionality into `BaseMockController`.

    * Use new standardized frame IDs for data from the low-level controller.
      Provide these values in a new `FrameId` enum class.
      Eliminate the FRAME_ID class constant in config and telemetry structs.

    * `Command`: replace the ``sync_pattern`` field with ``commander``.
      The new field has a standard value for commands from the CSC, which is provided as a `Command` class constant.

    * `Header`: update the type of the ``frame_id`` field to match a change in the low-level controllers.

* `CommandTelemetryClient`: expand the ``connected`` property to check that the reader is not None.
  The main driver was to make type checkers happier, but it also adds a modicum of safety.

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.8
* ts_idl 3.6
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 10.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.27.0
-------

v0.26.0
-------

* Updated unit tests for compatibility with ts_salobj 6.8, which is now required.
* `CONFIG_SCHEMA`: update id link to use `main` instead of `master`.
* ``setup.cfg``: prevent pytest from checking version.py

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.8
* ts_idl 3.6
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.25.0
-------

* `CommandTelemetryClient` and `CommandTelemetryServer`: support command acknowledgement:

    * Change ``CommandTelemetryClient.put_command`` to `CommandTelemetryClient.run_command`.
    * Add `CommandStatusCode` enum, `CommandStatus` struct, and `CommandError` exception.

* `BaseCsc`: update for command acknowledgement.

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.3

* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.24.0
-------

* `BaseCsc`:

    * Go to FAULT state and report error code NO_CONFIG if the low-level controller does not report config shortly after connecting.
      This requires ts_idl 3.6.
    * Remove the deprecated ``schema_path`` constructor argument.
      It and was not being used.

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 3.6
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.23.1
-------

* `BaseCsc`: go to FAULT state if the CSC cannot connect to the low-level controller.
* Modernize unit tests to use bare assert.

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.23.0
-------

* Swap client and server, so the client runs in the CSC and the server runs in the mock controller.
  This change requires new versions of the low-level controller code: ts_hexapod_controller and ts_rotator_controller (see ts_mthexapod and ts_mtrotator for details).

* `BaseCsc` changes:

    * Connect to the low-level controller as part of the ``start`` command.
    * Make the CSC summary state mostly independent of the low-level controller state (an excellent suggestion from Tiago).
      As part of the ``enable`` command, the CSC commands the low-level controller to its own enabled state,
      including clearing errors, if necessary.
      See :ref:`communication protocol <lsst.ts.hexrotcomm_communication_protocol>` for more information.
    * Configuration should now include fields for TCP/IP host, port and connection_timeout.
      An alternative for the first two is to override the default host and port properties.
    * The ``clearError`` command is no longer supported (and will be removed in a future ticket).
      Use the standard sequence ``standby``, ``start``, and ``enable`` to recover from errors.
    * The CSC is no longer alive in the OFFLINE state.
    * Update to use `lsst.ts.idl.enums.MTRotator.ErrorCode`, which requires ts_idl 3.4.

* `CommandTelemetryServer`: make the `host` constructor argument optional, with a default of ``tcpip.LOCALHOST_IPV4``.
  Also prohibit constructing with host=None and port=0, to make sure we can determine the randomly chosen ports.
* Add optional ``host`` constructor argument to `BaseMockController` and `SimpleMockController`.
* Add a ``Jenkinsfile``.
* setup.cfg: add [options] section.

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.22.0
-------

* Make state transition commands more reliable and more efficient:
  allow more time for the low-level controller to implement the change,
  and stop waiting as soon as the change is reported.
* Updated to use ts_utils, which is required.
* `BaseCsc`:

    * Add ``wait_summary_state`` method.
    * ``assert_summary_state`` method: deprecate the ``isbefore`` argument.

* `CommandTelemetryServer`:

    * Remove the `skip` argument of the ``next_telemetry`` method.
      It is much better to check each telemetry packet for the data you are awaiting.
    * Remove diagnostic print statements.

* `test_command_telemetry_server.py`: fix test cleanup, which was not running due to a typo.

Requires:

* ts_utils 1
* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.21.0
-------

Deprecations:

* You should obtain the following from ts_tcpip: OneClientServer, close_stream_writer, read_into, write_from, LOCAL_HOST.
  At some point these symbols will no longer be available from ts_hexrotcomm.

* Use the new ts_tcpip package.
  Temporarily make the symbols that moved available in lsst.ts.hexrotcomm, for backwards compatibility.
* Test black formatting with pytest instead of a custom unit test.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_tcpip 0.1
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.20.0
-------

* Change message headers to use TAI unix time.
  Rename the fields from tv_sec, tv_nsec to tai_sec, tai_nsec and set them accordingly.
  Note that this requires a corresponding update to the low-level rotator and hexapod controllers
  (see `DM-26451 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-26451>`_
  and `DM-30120 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-30120>`_)

* `BaseCsc`: change ``assert_enabled`` to check that the CSC can command the low-level controller
  (like the other, similar, assert methods).
* `BaseCsc`: added method ``basic_run_command``.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.18.0
-------

* `BaseCsc`: add ``write_lock`` attribute and aquire this lock while writing a command to the low-level controller.
  You should acquire this lock before cancelling any task that sends commands to the low-level controller,
  to prevent writing partial commands and leaving data in the TCP/IP stream buffer.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2

v0.17.0
-------

* `close_stream_writer`: swallow `ConnectionResetError`, since this means the writer is closing or closed.
* `OneClientServer`: bug fix: ``connect_callback`` was not reliably called by ``close_client``.
* `SimpleCsc`: update to write the ``rotation`` MTRotator telemetry topic,
  instead of the deprecated ``application`` telemetry topic.
* `CommandTelemetryClient`: always set a writer attribute to `None` when closing it,
  to eliminate any danger of trying to close a writer twice.
* Use `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase` instead of the abandoned asynctest package.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_xml 7.2

v0.16.0
-------

* `BaseCsc`: add ``config_schema`` constructor argument.
  This requires ts_salobj 6.3.
* `SimpleCsc`: specify config schema using the ``config_schema`` argument.
* Delete obsolete file ``schema/MTRotator.yaml``.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.3
* ts_idl 2.2

* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.15.0
-------

* Update for ts_xml 7.2 (which is required for the unit tests to pass): add ``do_fault`` method to `SimpleCsc`.
* `CommandTelemetryServer`: improve handling of invalid headers:

    * Flush the remaining data and try to continue, instead of disconnecting.
    * Print the header bytes when an unrecognized frame ID is read.

* Modernize ``doc/conf.py`` for documenteer 0.6.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.1
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_xml 7.2
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.14.0
-------

* Support different ports for different CSCs:

    * Eliminate COMMAND_PORT and TELEMETRY_PORT constants.
    * `CommandTelemetryServer`: replace use_random_port argument with port.
    * `CommandTelemetryClient` and `BaseMockController`: make the command_port and telemetry_port arguments required.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 6.1
* ts_idl 2.2
* ts_xml 7
* MTRotator IDL file, e.g. built using ``make_idl_file.py MTRotator`` (for `SimpleCsc` and unit tests)

v0.13.0
-------

v0.12.0
-------

* Update the mock controller to make the time used in update_telemetry match the time in the header:

    * Update `CommandTelemetryClient.update_and_get_header` to return the current time in addition to the header,
      and update the call to `update_telemetry` to provide that time.
    * Update `BaseMockController,update_telemetry` and `SimpleMockController.update_telemetry` to receive time as an argument.

Requires:

* Bug fix: `BaseCsc.get_config_pkg` returned "ts_config_ocs" instead of "ts_config_mttcs".

* Add missing call to ``begin_start`` to `BaseCsc.do_start`.
* Make `BaseCsc.fault` raise `NotImplementedError`, since the low-level controller maintains the summary state and offers no command to transition to the FAULT state.

Requires:

* ts_salobj 5.11 - 6
* ts_idl 1 (with salobj 5) or 2 (with salobj 6)
* ts_xml 4.6 - 6
