    Parameters
    ----------
    name : `str`
        Name of SAL component.
    index : `int` or `None` (optional)
        SAL component index, or 0 or None if the component is not indexed.
        A value is required if the component is indexed.
    CommandCode : `enum`
        Command codes supported by the low-level controller.
        Must include ``SET_STATE`` and ``ENABLE_DRIVES``, the two command codes
        used by this class.
    ConfigClass : `ctypes.Structure`
        Configuration structure.
    TelemetryClass : `ctypes.Structure`
        Telemetry structure.
    config_schema : `dict` or None, optional
        Configuration schema, as a dict in jsonschema format.
    config_dir : `str`, optional
        Directory of configuration files, or None for the standard
        configuration directory (obtained from `_get_default_config_dir`).
        This is provided for unit testing.
    initial_state : `lsst.ts.salobj.State` or `int` (optional)
        The initial state of the CSC.
    override : `str`, optional
        Configuration override file to apply if ``initial_state`` is
        `State.DISABLED` or `State.ENABLED`.
    simulation_mode : `int` (optional)
        Simulation mode. Allowed values:

        * 0: regular operation.
        * 1: simulation: use a mock low level controller.

    Notes
    -----
    **Error Codes**

    * `ErrorCode.CONTROLLER_FAULT`:
      The low-level controller went to fault state.
    * `ErrorCode.CONNECTION_LOST`:
      Lost connection to the low-level controller.

    Subclasses may add additional error codes.

    **Configuration**

    The configuration for subclasses must include the following fields,
    or, for ``host`` and ``port``, the subclass may override the
    `host` and `port` properties (needed for MTHexapod):

    * host (string):
        TCP/IP host address of low-level controller.
    * port (integer):
        TCP/IP port of low-level controller.
    * connection_timeout (number):
        Time limit for connection to the low-level controller

    Both host and port are ignored in simulation mode; the host is
    `lsst.ts.tcpip.LOCALHOST_IPV4` and the ports are automatically assigned.
